## Using as Middleware

Cloud Commander could be used as middleware for `node.js` applications based on [socket.io](http://socket.io "Socket.IO") and [express](http://expressjs.com "Express"):

Init `package.json`:

```
npm init -y
```

Install dependencies:

```
npm i cloudcmd express socket.io -S
```

And create `index.js`:

```js
const http = require('http');
const cloudcmd = require('cloudcmd');
const io = require('socket.io');
const app = require('express')();

const port = 1337;
const prefix = '/';

const server = http.createServer(app);
const socket = io.listen(server, {
    path: `${prefix}/socket.io`
});

const config = {
    name: 'cloudcmd :)',
};

const plugins = [
    __dirname + '/plugin.js'
];

const filePicker = {
    data: {
        FilePicker: {
            key: 'key',
        }
    }
};

// override option from json/modules.json
const modules = {
    filePicker,
};

const {
    createConfigManager,
    configPath,
} = cloudcmd;

const configManager = createConfigManager({
    configPath,
}),

app.use(prefix, cloudcmd({
    socket,  // used by Config, Edit (optional) and Console (required)
    config,  // config data (optional)
    plugins, // DEPRECATED, use User Menu instead
    modules, // optional
    configManager, // optional
}));

server.listen(port);
```

Docker
---------------
`Cloud Commander` could be used as a [docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/coderaiser/cloudcmd/ "Docker container") this way:

```sh
docker run -t --rm -v ~:/root -v /:/mnt/fs -w=/root -p 8000:8000 coderaiser/cloudcmd
```

Config would be read from home directory, hosts root file system would be mount to `/mnt/fs`,
`8000` port would be exposed to hosts port.

Also you could use [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/ "Docker Compose") with `docker-compose.yml`:

```yml
version: '2'
services:
  web:
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
    volumes:
      - ~:/root
      - /:/mnt/fs
    image: coderaiser/cloudcmd
```

When you create this file run:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

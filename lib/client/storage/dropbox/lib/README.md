# dropbox.js Build Directory

dropbox.js is written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), and its
source code is in the `src/` directory. The `lib/` directory contains the
compiled JavaScript produced by the build process.

The
[development guide](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/development.md)
contains a step-by-step guide to the library's build process, and will help you
populate this directory.
